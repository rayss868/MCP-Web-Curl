## ‚ú® Features

### Storage & Download Details

- üóÇÔ∏è Error log rotation: `logs/error-log.txt` is rotated when it exceeds ~1MB (renamed to `error-log.txt.bak`) to prevent unbounded growth.
- üßπ Logs & temp cleanup: old temporary files in the `logs/` directory are cleaned up at startup.
- üõë Browser lifecycle: Puppeteer browser instances are closed in finally blocks to avoid Chromium temp file leaks.
- üîé Content extraction:
  - Returns raw text, HTML, and Readability "main article" when available. Readability attempts to extract the primary content of a webpage, removing headers, footers, sidebars, and other non-essential elements, providing a cleaner, more focused text.
  - Readability output is subject to `startIndex`/`maxLength`/`chunkSize` slicing when requested.
- üö´ Resource blocking: `blockResources` is now always forced to `false`, meaning resources are never blocked for faster page loads.
- ‚è±Ô∏è Timeout control: navigation and API request timeouts are configurable via tool arguments.
- üíæ Output: results can be printed to stdout or written to a file via CLI options.
- ‚¨áÔ∏è Download behavior (`download_file`):
  - `destinationFolder` accepts relative paths (resolved against `process.cwd()`) or absolute paths.
  - The server creates `destinationFolder` if it does not exist.
  - Downloads are streamed using Node streams + `pipeline` to minimize memory use and ensure robust writes.
  - Filenames are derived from the URL path (e.g., `https://.../path/file.jpg` -> `file.jpg`). If no filename is present, the fallback name is `downloaded_file`.
  - Overwrite semantics: by default the implementation will overwrite an existing file with the same name. To avoid overwrite, provide a unique `destinationFolder` or include a unique filename (timestamp, uuid) in the URL path or destination prior to calling the tool. (Optionally the code can be extended to support a `noOverwrite` flag to auto-rename files‚Äîask if you want this implemented.)
  - Error handling: non-2xx responses cause a thrown error; partial writes are avoided by streaming through `pipeline` and only returning the final path on success.
- üñ•Ô∏è Usage modes: CLI and MCP server (stdin/stdout transport).
- üåê REST client: `fetch_api` returns JSON/text when appropriate and base64 for binary responses.
- Note: `fetch_api` now requires a numeric `limit` parameter; responses will be truncated to at most `limit` characters. The response object includes `bodyLength` (original length in characters) and `truncated` (boolean).
- `fetch_api` is marked `autoApprove` in the MCP tool listing so compatible MCP hosts may invoke it without interactive approval. Internal calls in this codebase use a sensible default `limit` of 1000 characters where applicable.
- üîç Google Custom Search: requires `APIKEY_GOOGLE_SEARCH` and `CX_GOOGLE_SEARCH`.
- ü§ñ Smart command:
  - Auto language detection (franc-min) and optional translation (dynamic `translate` import). Translation is a best-effort fallback and may fail silently; original text is preserved on failure.
  - Query enrichment is heuristic-based; results depend on the detected intent.
- üìÑ fetch_webpage specifics:
  - Multi-page crawling via `nextPageSelector` (tries href first, falls back to clicking the element).
  - Content is now whitespace-removed from the entire HTML before slicing.
  - Returns sliced content, total characters (after whitespace removal), `startIndex`, `maxLength`, `remainingCharacters`, and an `instruction` for fetching more content (includes a suggestion to stop if enough information is gathered).
  - Required parameters: `startIndex` (or alias `index`) and at least one of `chunkSize` (preferred), `limit` (alias), or `maxLength` must be provided and be a number. Calls missing these required parameters will be rejected with an InvalidParams error. Set these values according to your needs; they may not be empty.
  - Validation behavior: runtime validation is enforced in `src/index.ts` and the MCP tool will throw/reject when required parameters are missing or invalid. If you prefer automatic fallbacks instead of rejection, modify the validation logic in `src/index.ts`.
- üõ°Ô∏è Debug & Logging
  - Runtime logs: detailed runtime errors and debug traces are written to `logs/error-log.txt` by default.
  - Debug flag: some CLI/tool paths accept a `debug` argument which enables more verbose console logging; not all code paths consistently honor a `debug` flag yet. Prefer inspecting `logs/error-log.txt` for complete traces.
  - To enable console-level debug consistently, a small code change to read a `DEBUG=true` env var or a global `--debug` CLI option can be added (recommended for development).
- ‚öôÔ∏è Compatibility & Build notes
  - The project now utilizes the native global `fetch` API available in Node.js 18+, eliminating the need for the `node-fetch` dependency. This simplifies the dependency tree and leverages built-in capabilities.
  - `npm run build` runs `tsc` and a `chmod` step that is no-op on Windows; CI or cross-platform scripts should guard `chmod` with a platform check.
- üîê Security considerations
  - SSRF: validate/whitelist destination hosts if exposing `fetch_api`/`fetch_webpage` publicly.
  - Rate limiting & auth: add request rate limiting and access controls for public deployments.
  - Puppeteer flags: `--no-sandbox` reduces isolation; only use it where required and understand the risk on multi-tenant systems.
- üß™ Tests & linting
  - Linting: `npm run lint` is provided; including a pre-commit hook (e.g., using `husky` and `lint-staged`) is recommended to enforce linting standards before commits, ensuring code quality.
  - Tests: Currently, no unit tests are included. Future plans involve adding comprehensive integration tests for core functionalities like `fetch_api` and `download_file` to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.
- üìë All tool schemas and documentation are in English for clarity.

```
*   **CLI & MCP Server**: [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts)
    Implements both the CLI entry point and the MCP server, exposing tools like `fetch_webpage`, `fetch_api`, `google_search`, and `smart_command`.
*   **Web Scraping**: Uses Puppeteer for headless browsing, resource blocking, and content extraction.
*   **REST Client**: [`src/rest-client.ts`](src/rest-client.ts)
    Provides a flexible HTTP client for API requests, used by both CLI and MCP tools.
*   **Configuration**: Managed via CLI options, environment variables, and tool arguments.
    *   Note: the server creates `logs/` at startup and resolves relative paths against `process.cwd()`. Tools exposed include `download_file` (streaming writes), `fetch_webpage`, `fetch_api`, `google_search`, and `smart_command`.

<a name="usage"></a>
## üöÄ Usage

### CLI Usage

The CLI supports fetching and extracting text content from web pages.

```bash
# Basic usage
node build/index.js https://example.com

# With options
node build/index.js --timeout 30000 --no-block-resources https://example.com

# Save output to a file
node build/index.js -o result.json https://example.com
```

#### Command Line Options

- `--timeout <ms>`: Set navigation timeout (default: 60000)
- `--no-block-resources`: This option is now deprecated as resource blocking is always disabled by default.
- `-o <file>`: Output result to specified file

### MCP Server Usage

Web-curl can be run as an MCP server for integration with Roo Context or other MCP-compatible environments.

#### Exposed Tools

- **fetch_webpage**: Retrieve text, html, main article content, and metadata from a web page. Supports multi-page crawling (pagination) and debug mode.
- **fetch_api**: Make REST API requests with custom methods, headers, body, timeout, and debug mode.
- **google_search**: Search the web using Google Custom Search API, with advanced filters (language, region, site, dateRestrict) and debug mode.
- **smart_command**: Free-form command with automatic language detection, translation, query enrichment, and debug mode.
- **download_file**: Download a file from a given URL to a specified folder.

#### Running as MCP Server

```bash
npm run start
```

The server will communicate via stdin/stdout and expose the tools as defined in [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts:42).

#### MCP Tool Example (fetch_webpage)

```json
{
  "name": "fetch_webpage",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "timeout": 60000,
    "maxLength": 10000
  }
}
```

---

### üö¶ Content Slicing Example (Recommended for Large Pages)

For large documents, you can fetch content in slices using `startIndex` and `maxLength`. The server will return the sliced content, the total characters available (after whitespace removal), and an instruction for fetching the next part.

Client request for first slice:
```json
{
  "name": "fetch_webpage",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com/long-article",
    "blockResources": false,
    "timeout": 60000,
    "maxLength": 2000,     // maximum number of characters to return for this slice
    "startIndex": 0
  }
}
```

Server response (example):
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/long-article",
  "title": "Long Article Title",
  "content": "First 2000 characters of the whitespace-removed HTML...",
  "fetchedAt": "2025-08-19T15:00:00.000Z",
  "startIndex": 0,
  "maxLength": 2000,
  "remainingCharacters": 8000, // Total characters - (startIndex + content.length)
  "instruction": "To fetch more content, call fetch_webpage again with startIndex=2000."
}
```

Client fetches the next slice by setting `startIndex` to the previous `startIndex + content.length`:
```json
{
  "name": "fetch_webpage",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://example.com/long-article",
    "maxLength": 2000,
    "startIndex": 2000 // From the instruction in the previous response
  }
}
```

- Continue fetching until `remainingCharacters` is 0 and the `instruction` indicates all content has been fetched.
- The `content` field will contain the sliced, whitespace-removed HTML.

#### Google Search Integration

Set the following environment variables for Google Custom Search:

- `APIKEY_GOOGLE_SEARCH`: Your Google API key
- `CX_GOOGLE_SEARCH`: Your Custom Search Engine ID

---

<a name="configuration"></a>
## üß© Configuration

- **Resource Blocking**: Block images, stylesheets, and fonts for faster page loading.
- **Timeout**: Set navigation and API request timeouts.
- **Custom Headers**: Pass custom HTTP headers for advanced scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

- **Timeout Errors**: Increase the `timeout` parameter if requests are timing out.
- **Blocked Content**: If content is missing, try disabling resource blocking or adjusting `resourceTypesToBlock`.
- **Google Search Fails**: Ensure `APIKEY_GOOGLE_SEARCH` and `CX_GOOGLE_SEARCH` are set in your environment.
- **Binary/Unknown Content**: Non-text responses are base64-encoded.
- **Error Logs**: Check the `logs/error-log.txt` file for detailed error messages.

## üß† Tips & Best Practices {#tips--best-practices}

<details>
<summary>Click for advanced tips</summary>

- Resource blocking is always disabled, ensuring faster and lighter scraping.
- For large pages, use `maxLength` and `startIndex` to fetch content in slices. The server will provide `remainingCharacters` and an `instruction` for fetching the next part (includes a suggestion to stop if enough information is gathered).
- Always validate your tool arguments to avoid errors.
- Secure your API keys and sensitive data using environment variables.
- Review the MCP tool schemas in [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) for all available options.
